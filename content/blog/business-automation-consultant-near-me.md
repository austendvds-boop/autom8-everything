A strong automation consultant should connect technical implementation to operational outcomes your team can actually sustain.

## Consultant evaluation criteria

Review discovery depth, implementation documentation, and change-management process.

Consultants who ignore team adoption often deliver short-lived gains.

## Local and remote collaboration

Nearby consultants can accelerate alignment, but remote execution can still be excellent with clear communication cadence.

Choose based on execution quality, not geography alone.
