Business automation means using software and connected workflows to move repetitive work out of your team's inboxes and into reliable systems.

## What business automation actually covers

Most owners hear automation and think only about email sequences. In practice, automation spans lead capture, onboarding, fulfillment, reporting, and retention workflows.

The best systems remove handoff delays and manual copy-paste. Your team spends less time chasing status updates and more time closing and serving clients.

## How to pick your first automations

Start with workflows that are high-frequency and easy to standardize. Lead response speed, appointment reminders, and invoice follow-up are common quick wins.

Document the current process first, then automate one stage at a time. This keeps quality high while reducing implementation risk.
