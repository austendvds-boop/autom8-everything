CRM automation succeeds when lifecycle stages, owner logic, and reporting definitions are standardized before workflows go live.

## Standardize lifecycle fields first

Define each stage clearly so automations can move records accurately. Ambiguous stage definitions create reporting noise.

Set required fields at handoff points to keep data quality high.

## Design follow-up rules by intent

Use intent signals like form type, page viewed, and source channel to personalize sequence timing and messaging.

This keeps your automation responsive while avoiding over-communication.
