Small business automation works best when you prioritize one bottleneck at a time and keep owners close to implementation decisions.

## Audit your current workflow first

Create a simple map from lead intake to paid delivery. Mark every point where people wait on information, reminders, or approvals.

Those waiting points are usually where automation creates the fastest margin and speed gains.

## Automate with clear ownership

Assign a workflow owner for each automated process. They monitor exceptions, improve prompts, and update rules when the business changes.

Automation should reduce management overhead, not create hidden technical debt.
