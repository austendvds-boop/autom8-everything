A complete GoHighLevel setup should combine clean pipeline architecture, messaging workflows, and conversion tracking from day one.

## Core setup priorities

Configure pipelines, stage rules, custom fields, and role permissions before building automation layers.

This avoids rework and keeps reporting clean.

## Automation and tracking stack

Launch lead response, appointment reminders, and missed-call text-back workflows first.

Then add attribution tracking and conversion dashboards for offer-level decision making.
