You can forecast automation ROI with a few practical inputs: time saved, error reduction, conversion lift, and reclaimed capacity.

## Core ROI inputs

Track current manual hours by workflow, then estimate realistic automation coverage. Multiply saved hours by loaded hourly cost.

Layer in conversion lift from faster follow-up and better lead routing.

## Decision-ready output

Calculate monthly gain, implementation cost, and payback period in months.

Use conservative assumptions for planning and optimistic scenarios for upside modeling.
