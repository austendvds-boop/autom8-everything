Local SEO automation is about consistency at scale: page production, metadata standards, internal links, and citation hygiene.

## Automation-ready local SEO assets

Start with standardized page templates, schema modules, and internal-link rules so each new location page launches cleanly.

Use editorial QA to keep local relevance and avoid thin content.

## Operational cadence

Run monthly audits for NAP consistency, crawl coverage, and service-page indexing.

Feed performance insights back into content and conversion updates.
