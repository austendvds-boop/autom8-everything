Choosing an automation agency is less about tool logos and more about execution discipline, reporting clarity, and operational ownership.

## Look for process thinking, not just tool setup

Strong agencies start with workflow architecture and KPI targets. Weak agencies jump straight into software configuration.

Ask for examples of process maps, QA checklists, and post-launch optimization plans.

## Demand measurable success criteria

Before kickoff, define baselines for response time, conversion rate, and manual hours saved. If no one can define success, scope creep follows.

A reliable partner will tie implementation milestones to clear business outcomes.
