Zapier and Make both work well for small businesses, but they fit different workflow maturity levels.

## When Zapier is the better choice

Zapier is faster to launch and easier for non-technical teams to maintain. It is ideal for straightforward cross-app workflows.

If speed and operational simplicity matter most, Zapier usually wins.

## When Make is the better choice

Make is strong for visually complex branching workflows and advanced logic at scale.

Teams with heavier technical support can get strong cost-performance from Make.
