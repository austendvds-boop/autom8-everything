You do not need enterprise software to automate effectively. Most wins come from connecting tools you already use.

## High-impact idea categories

Focus on lead intake, booking confirmations, no-show prevention, proposal reminders, and onboarding workflows first.

Then expand into internal reporting, QA alerts, and renewal campaigns.

## Implementation order

Start with customer-facing speed improvements, then automate internal handoffs and analytics workflows.

This sequence improves revenue while creating momentum for broader adoption.
