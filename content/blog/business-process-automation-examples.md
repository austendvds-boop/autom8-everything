The highest-ROI process automations are usually the ones your team repeats daily with clear rules and frequent handoffs.

## Sales and intake examples

New leads can be enriched, scored, and routed automatically, then followed by a timed outreach sequence.

This prevents lead leakage and keeps pipeline ownership clear.

## Delivery and finance examples

Automated kickoff tasks, milestone reminders, and invoice nudges keep projects moving without constant manual coordination.

When workflow state changes trigger next actions, teams stay aligned.
