DIY automation can work for simple flows, but agency support becomes valuable when revenue-critical workflows involve multiple systems.

## When DIY is a smart move

If your use case is one app trigger plus a simple notification, DIY can be fast and affordable.

Use templates, test edge cases, and document every workflow so your team can maintain it.

## When agency support pays off

Complex lead routing, CRM syncing, and reporting pipelines need architecture, QA, and change management.

An agency can prevent hidden failures that quietly hurt conversion and client experience.
