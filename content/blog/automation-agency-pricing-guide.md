Automation pricing varies by workflow complexity, integration depth, and the level of strategic support included after launch.

## Common pricing structures

Most engagements use fixed-scope builds, monthly retainer optimization, or hybrid models. Fixed scope is best when requirements are stable.

Retainers work best when your team needs ongoing iteration, experimentation, and performance monitoring.

## How to calculate ROI before signing

Estimate monthly time saved, conversion lift from faster follow-up, and errors reduced from manual work. Add opportunity value from capacity unlocked.

If expected gains can repay implementation in 3-6 months, the project is usually financially healthy.
