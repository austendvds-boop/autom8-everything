Email automation should mirror your customer journey, from first inquiry through post-delivery expansion opportunities.

## Three workflows every service business should deploy

Start with inquiry follow-up, proposal nurturing, and client onboarding workflows. These cover the highest-impact communication moments.

Each sequence should include clear next steps and contextual links to service pages.

## Keep deliverability and engagement healthy

Use domain authentication, clean segmentation, and suppression logic for disengaged contacts.

Automation volume should increase relevance, not inbox fatigue.
