## B6 (2026-03-07): Review Funnel page overhaul
- Modified: `src/app/services/review-funnel/page.tsx`
  - Hero headline replaced with: `Your Reputation Compounds. Every Review Brings the Next Customer.`
  - Hero subhead replaced with compounding reputation framing.
  - Added new `Why Reviews Compound` section after hero with 3 stat cards:
    - `93%` (BrightLocal 2024)
    - `266%` (Womply Research)
    - `5-9%` (Harvard Business School)
  - Added compounding visual chip flow:
    - More reviews → Higher ranking → More clicks → More customers → More reviews
  - Upgraded `How it works` into visual connected flow with icons and desktop connector arrows:
    - Step 1 `Connect Calendar` (`Calendar`)
    - Step 2 `Automatic Text` (`MessageSquare`)
    - Step 3 `Reviews Roll In` (`Star`)
  - Added TODO above testimonials array:
    - `Replace with real client testimonials — use real first name and business name when available`
  - Kept testimonial descriptors as requested:
    - `Home Services Team`, `Med Spa Owner`, `Dental Office Manager`
  - Added new `Common Concerns` section before FAQ (3 concern cards).
  - Added new `Even Better Together: Cadence + Review Funnel` section before final CTA:
    - side-by-side Cadence/Review Funnel cards
    - combined pricing line `$278/mo combined`
    - supporting line `Cadence $199/mo + Review Funnel Starter $79/mo`
    - CTA `Start with Both` -> `/contact`
- Section order now matches requested 10-block flow:
  1) Hero
  2) Reputation compounding stats
  3) Pricing
  4) Comparison table
  5) How it works (visual)
  6) Testimonials
  7) Common Concerns
  8) Bundle CTA
  9) FAQ
  10) Final CTA
- Modified docs:
  - `docs/UI-VERIFICATION.md`
  - `docs/implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/CODER-CONTEXT.md`
  - `docs/ralph-context.md`
- Key exports/components touched:
  - `ReviewFunnelPage` (default export, unchanged route/export surface)
- Gotchas for next batch:
  - `How it works` now depends on `lucide-react` imports (`Calendar`, `MessageSquare`, `Star`, `PhoneCall`, `MessageSquareHeart`) in this page file.
